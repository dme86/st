# st - simple terminal

This is my customized version of the [Suckless Simple Terminal](https://st.suckless.org/), tailored to meet my specific requirements.

To install it on a Linux system with Xserver, please clone this repository and execute the command 

`sudo make install`.

Scrollback functionality can be accessed using `Shift` + `PgUp/PgDn`.
